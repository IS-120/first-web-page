| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| I recommend creating a folder on your computer specifically for this class and choosing it to clone all your assignment repos into. |

At the top right of your Github repo, find and click the Code button and copy the URL in the HTTPS field (see image below)

![location of clone url](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsburtonBYU/codepen-images/main/code-clone.png)

Open VS Code, and choose "Clone Git repository" on the welcome screen or in the command palette, `View -> Command Palette...`. Paste the URL, select a folder on your computer to copy the containing repo folder and its files, and when prompted, open the local copy of the repo in VS Code.

## :page_facing_up: Create and personalize your index.html file

Open the Explorer sidebar. Either click on the Explorer icon in the VS Code Activity Bar (vertical menu with icons) or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-B` on a PC or `‚åòB` on a Mac. Next, open the `index.html` file.

The file should be empty. Use Emmet to generate a the basic structure of an HTML file: type an exclamation point `!` and press `Tab`. You should see the following markup appear in the file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

### Configuring `<head>`

Elements in the `<head>` section of an HTML file are not visible on the page. They are used to configure the page, and give information to the browser and search engines.

#### Page title

- In the `<head>` section, find the `<title>` element and add a title for your page. Name it anything you'd like. For information on best practices for page titles, see MDN's [The document title element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title).

A **tl;dr** from the MDN link, the page title should be:

- _for SEO_
  - descriptive of the page
  - less than 55-60 characters long
  - unique for each page
- _for accessibility_

  - followed by the website name; for example, if you were writing a website about Possums called "Possum Palooza", your home page title might look like this:

    ```html
    <title>Home - Possum Palooza</title>
    ```

#### Page description

Web pages should include a _meta description_ which is a short summary of what the page is about. Meta descriptions help with SEO (search engine optimization). If a meta description exists, it's displayed in online search results. Meta descriptions should be kept under 150 characters long.

- In the `<head>` above `<title>` enter a new line
- On the new line, use Emmet: type `meta:desc` and press `TAB`. The following HTML should appear:<br> `<meta name="description" content="">`
- Add a description of your page between the double quotes of the content attribute

#### üòÅ Favicon

A favicon is a small icon that appears in a browser's address bar, on a browser tab, and on bookmarks. Favicons are important for branding and user experience. They help users identify your site and make it easier to find your site in their browser history.

![favicon browser tab](readme-assets/browser-tab.png)

By default, browsers look in the root folder of a website for a `favicon.ico` file. At a bare minimum, you should include a `favicon.ico` file in your root folder (where your index.html file is located).

Modern browsers can display higher resolution favicons, so it's best to include different versions of your favicon.

- Use [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) to either convert a PNG file (upload a square PNG file with a _simple image_ that's at least 200px wide) or generate one from text or an emoji.
- Download the images the site generates and extract them into your`images` folder.
- Move the `favicon.ico` from your `images` folder to your root folder (same location as your `index.html` file).
- Copy the HTML from the `favicon.io` site and paste it into the `<head>` section of your `index.html` file.
- Change the path in the copied HTML to point to the files in your `images` folder. Because of some quirks with how Github pages works, you will also need to add a `.` before your `image` folder in the path (you do not, and should not, add the `.` to paths in your `<body>` section). The HTML in your head should look like this:

  ```html
  <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="./images/apple-touch-icon.png">
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="./images/favicon-32x32.png">
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="./images/favicon-16x16.png">
  <link rel="manifest" href="./images/site.webmanifest">
  ```

| ‚ö†Ô∏è Check your formatting  |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| When you save your `index.html` file, check that your `<link>` tags do not end with a `/>` and/or are broken up to several lines. This means Prettier is formatting your HTML. If this is the case, you need to disable Prettier formatting for HTML. See the **Configure VS Code** page on Learning Suite for information on how to do this. |

### Configuring `<body>`

Elements in the `<body>` section of an HTML file are visible on the browser page. They are used to display content to the user.

- Add a heading. Below the `<body>` tag, type `h1` and press `TAB`
- Add some heading text between the `<h1>` tags. Heading text is important for search engine optimization. Choose a heading that accurately describes your page. By convention, you should only have one `<h1>` element per page.
- On a new line below your `<h1>`, type `p` and press `TAB`
- Add some text inside the `<p>` tags.
- Save your file

## :computer: Use Live Server to preview your webpage

Before you open your webpage in Live Server, check the bottom left status bar on VS Code. You want to make sure you don't have any errors or warnings which should look like this:<br><br>
![no errors or warnings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsburtonBYU/codepen-images/main/errors.png)<br><br>
If you have errors or warnings, click on the icons to see what they are and fix them.

Once any problems are fixed, either choose "Go Live" in the bottom right of the status bar, or find and select "Go Live" in `View -> Command Palette...` to view your webpage in a browser.

Make sure that you can see your favicon in the browser tab. Sometimes favicon changes aren't loaded right away and you may need to _hard reload_ your page to see the changes.

| üí° How to hard reload a web page  |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 To force a page reload, on Window, press `Ctrl`-`Shift`-`R`or `Ctrl`-`F5`; on Mac press `‚åò`-`‚áß`-`R`.

If everything looks good then.....

## :arrow_up: Use VS Code's Source Control (in the sidebar) to commit your changes and sync these changes to Github

Open the Source Control menu from the VS Code Activity bar. You should see a list of files that have been changed. Enter a commit message and click the checkmark to commit your changes. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl`-`Enter` to commit your changes.

Open the repo in Github and check that you've passed the automated tests. Look at the top right of your repo header. If you have passed all the tests, you'll see a green check mark:

![passed tests](images/pass.png)

If you failed any tests, you will see a red X. Click on the X to see which test failed. Click on the failed test name for more details.

![failed tests](images/fail.png)

If you see a yellow dot, it means that the test is still running. Wait for the test to finish.

### Current automated tests

- HTML validation
- HTML proofer
- `<head>` should have a `<title>`
- `<head>` should have a `<meta>` description element
- `index.html` should contain an `<h1>`
- `index.html` should contain a `<p>`
- `index.html` should contain favicon information

## :rocket: Publish your site on Github pages

After you publish your site, wait a few minutes for it to generate. After it's generated, paste the link into your repo's about section. Also, feel free to delete the contents of `README.md` file from your repo. Change the `README.md` to add a description of your site. You can still view the original `README.md` file in the Feedback branch on Github.

## :no_entry_sign: Check that your site validates with no errors

Navigate to [Validator.nu](https://validator.nu/) and paste your Github Pages URL into the text field. Select "Show outline" and "Show image report." Click the "Check" button. If you have no errors or warnings, you're good to go! Take a screenshot of your validation report and add it the Feedback Pull-Request comment (see below).

## :speech_balloon: Leave a comment on the Feedback Pull-Request

On your Github repo, navigate to the Feedback pull requests. At the bottom of the page you will find a comment field. Leave a comment asking us to review your previous commit. Include your validator screenshot.
